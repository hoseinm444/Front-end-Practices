        In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language.<br>
        The Internet was without form and void, and text was upon the<br>
        face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the<br>
        face of the keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and<br>
        there were links. And Tim saw that the links were good; and<br>
        Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the linksGetting<br>
         Started with a Simple Web Page 27<br>
        Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole<br>
        thing together was the first Web Page.<br>
